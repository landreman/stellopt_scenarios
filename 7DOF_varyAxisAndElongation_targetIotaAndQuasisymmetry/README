This is a scenario with 7 independent variables, targeting both iota
and quasisymmetry.  There is no current or plasma pressure, i.e. the
configuration is a vacuum field.  There are 2 codes involved in
computing the objective function: VMEC and BOOZ_XFORM.

The independent variables represent the shape of the magnetic axis,
and the toroidal variation of the minor radius, elongation, and
rotation angle of the elliptical surfaces. The average major radius is
fixed at 1, and the average minor radius is fixed at 0.1.

More precisely, the independent variables are the Garabedian
coefficients Delta_{n,m} for the following values of (n,m):

(-1,1) and (1,1)  [Shape of the magnetic axis]
(0,2)             [Toroidally averaged elongation]
(-1,0) and (1,0)  [Toroidally varying minor radius]
(-1,2) and (1,2)  [Toroidally varying elongation]

The Garabedian Delta for (n,m)=(0,1) [Major radius / minor radius] is
fixed at 10, and the (n,m)=(0,0) coefficient [average minor radius] is
fixed at 1.

The objective function is
f = (iota - iota_target)^2 / sigma_iota^2 + Q^2,
where 
iota is the rotational transform on the magnetic axis,
iota_target = -0.41,
sigma_iota = 0.1,
and Q is a measure of the departure from quasisymmetry at the VMEC
boundary surface. The definition of Q in this example is different
from the one in the
2DOF_circularCrossSection_varyAxis_targetIotaAndQuasisymmetry
example. Here, stellopt considers Q to be the sum of 1040 quadratic
terms (one for each non-symmetric Fourier mode of |B| at the given
Fourier resolution), so the number of terms is larger than the number
of degrees of freedom (as needed by Levenberg-Mardquardt).

Stellopt seems to struggle with this example, in the following
way. The 'Levenberg-Marquardt_coldStart' subdirectory shows that when
stellopt is initialized with a particular initial condition far from
any optimum, by the 1719th function evaluation, it ends up at a point
where the objective function is f=1.7613E-03; the next ~8000 function
evaluations produce no improvement. However, when stellopt is
restarted from the endpoint of the first optimization, it reduces f to
1.5191E-03 already on the 15th function evaluation, and f is further
reduced to 1.0102E-03. Restarting again, f is further reduced. I don't
know if the issue is local minima, or perhaps resetting the
Levenberg parameter produces a better linesearch direction for some
reason.


The best optimum I have found so far is as follows:

f = 1.0086E-03

  RBC( 000,000) =    1.000000000000E+000    ZBS( 000,000) =    0.000000000000E+000
  RBC( 001,000) =   -9.380368462076E-003    ZBS( 001,000) =   -9.602636989978E-003
  RBC(-001,001) =    3.242425068324E-002    ZBS(-001,001) =   -2.976176077559E-002
  RBC( 000,001) =    9.943959510140E-002    ZBS( 000,001) =    1.005604048985E-001
  RBC( 001,001) =   -1.569371836431E-003    ZBS( 001,001) =   -1.427580686980E-003

The corresponding Garabedian coefficients are:
           n           m      Delta_{n,m}

Note that the order of elements in the x vector is
x(1) = DELTA(-001, 000) (n is before m)
x(2) = DELTA(-001, 001)
x(3) = DELTA(-001, 002)
x(4) = DELTA( 000, 002)
x(5) = DELTA( 001, 000)
x(6) = DELTA( 001, 001)
x(7) = DELTA( 001, 002)
(This can be seen from the var_labels file generated by stellopt.)
