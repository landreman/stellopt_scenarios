This is a scenario with 2 independent variables and 2 objectives.
There is no current or plasma pressure, i.e. the configuration is a vacuum field.
There is only a single code involved in computing the objective function: VMEC.
It should be straightforward to repeat this calculation using a different vacuum-field
code in place of VMEC.

The 2 independent variables are RBC(1,1) and ZBS(1,1), which control the shape of the plasma boundary:
R(phi) = 1 + 0.1 * cos(theta) + RBC(1,1) * cos(theta - 5 * phi),
Z(phi) =     0.1 * sin(theta) + ZBS(1,1) * sin(theta - 5 * phi).

The objective function is
f = (iota - iota_target)^2 + (volume - volume_target)^2,
where 
iota is the rotational transform on the magnetic axis,
iota_target = 0.41,
volume_target = 0.15 m^3,
and volume is the volume enclosed by the plasma boundary.

As can be seen in plotObjectiveFunction.pdf, the objective function is smooth.
The landscape of the total objective function has two long narrow valleys that are fairly straight.
When either of the two input parameters is +/- 0.1m, the boundary surface becomes infinitesmally thin, so VMEC is sure to fail.
In practice VMEC begins to struggle when RBC(1,1) or ZBS(1,1) approaches 0.08m, so it is convenient to include bound constraints
to stay away from these physical barriers in parameter space.

The optimum occurs at RBC(1,1) = 0.0313066948 m and ZBS(1,1) = -0.031232391 m.
At this point, iota(0) = 0.4114567, volume=0.178091, and the total objective function is 7.912501330E-04.
There is a symmetric optimum at RBC(1,0) = -0.0313066948 m and ZBS(1,1) = 0.031232391 m.
There are no other local optima within the non-pathological region bounded by +/- 0.1m.
