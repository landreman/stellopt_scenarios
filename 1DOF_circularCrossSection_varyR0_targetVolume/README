This is a minimal scenario. There is only 1 independent variable, and only a single term in the objective function.
The only code used is VMEC. There is no current or plasma pressure, i.e. the configuration is a vacuum field.

The 1 independent variable is the mean major radius, RBC(0,0).

The objective function is (V - V_target)^2, where V is the volume enclosed by the boundary, and V_target = 0.15 m^3.

Since the volume can be computed from the boundary shape analytically, there is not really a need to include VMEC or any other equilibrium code in this optimization.

As can be seen in plotObjectiveFunction.pdf, the objective function is smooth.

There is one optimum, at RBC(0,0) = 0.7599088773175m. At this point, the objective function is 0. There are no local optima other than this global optimum.

Even though there is only 1 degree of freedom, stellopt crashes if you try to run it using Levenbergâ€“Marquardt with only 1 proc.
