This is a scenario with 2 independent variables and 2 objectives.
There is no current or plasma pressure, i.e. the configuration is a vacuum field.
There are 2 codes involved in computing the objective function: VMEC and BOOZ_XFORM.

The 2 independent variables are RBC(1,0) and ZBS(1,0), which control the shape of the magnetic axis:
R(phi) = 1 + RBC(1,0) * cos(nfp * phi),
Z(phi) =     ZBS(1,0) * sin(nfp * phi).
The plasma has a circular cross-section with radius 0.1 in the (R,Z) plane (so it has a slightly elliptical cross-section
in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic axis.)

The objective function is
f = (iota - iota_target)^2 / sigma_iota^2 + Q^2,
where 
iota is the rotational transform on the magnetic axis,
iota_target = -0.41,
sigma_iota = 0.1,
and Q is a measure of the departure from quasisymmetry at the VMEC boundary surface.

As can be seen in plotObjectiveFunction.pdf, the objective function is fairly smooth, although there is some
numerical noise apparent in the Q term when R0C(1,0) is small.
The landscape of the total objective function resmbles that of the Rosenbrock function: there is a long narrow curved valley.

The optimum occurs at RBC(1,0) = 0.09223 and ZBS(1,0) = 0.09449. At this point, iota = -0.409707, Q=0.17702, and the total objective function is 0.03135.
There is a symmetric optimum at RBC(1,0) = -0.09223 and ZBS(1,0) = -0.09449. There are no other local optima.
