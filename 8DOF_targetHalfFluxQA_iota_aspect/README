This is a 2-field-period vacuum configuration, constrained to have
elliptical cross-section. We optimize for quasi-axisymmetry, also
targeting iota so the optimum is not true axisymmetry, and also
targeting the aspect ratio so the aspect ratio does not increase. If
more Fourier modes were allowed in the boundary shape, decent
quasi-axisymmetry could be achieved. However, here the Fourier content
is kept small so the parameter space is only 8-dimensional.

Quasisymmetry is targeted at the surface s=0.5. Since ns is even,
there is a half-mesh surface exactly at s=0.5.

This example is very similar to the 8DOF_targetBoundaryQA_iota_aspect
scenario. There are two differences: quasisymmetry is targeted at half
flux instead of the boundary, and ns is 50 instead of 51.

Iota is targeted at the edge, with a target value of -0.495, to avoid
the resonance at -0.5.  We do not attempt to control magnetic shear
here, since this is hard to do without more poloidal modes in the
boundary shape.

For this scenario, the quasisymmetry objective has no s-dependent or
m-dependent weighting of the Boozer amplitudes.  In stellopt, this is
achieved by setting sigma < 0.

The objective function is:

f = (aspect - 6)^2 + (iota + 0.495)^2 + sum_{m,n}(B_{m,n} / B0)^2

where the sum is over all quasisymmetry-breaking modes, B_{m,n} are
the amplitudes of |B| in Boozer coordinates. The normalizing field is

B0 = sqrt(\sum_{m,n} B_{m,n}^2)

where now the sum includes only quasisymmetric modes.

The number of least-squares terms in the objective function is 1042 in
stellopt. This large number is a function of the Fourier resolution in
Boozer coordinates. The number of residuals in simsopt is slightly
smaller, 1010. The difference is due to the fact that stellopt
includes terms corresponding to all the Boozer modes, not just the
non-symmetric ones, with the symmetric modes set to 0; simsopt
includes only the non-symmetric modes in the residual vector.

Note that `vmec_axis_option="vmec"` in the stellopt cases. This
ensures that the same initialization of the magnetic axis is used in
stellopt and simsopt. If the axis is initialized differently, the
Boozer harmonics turn out a little different.

The parameter space is

rc(0, 1) 
rc(1,-1) 
rc(1, 0) 
rc(1, 1) 
zs(0, 1) 
zs(1,-1) 
zs(1, 0) 
zs(1, 1) 

where m comes before n (opposite to stellopt/vmec notation).

At the initial condition, B0 = 8.20764568, f = 1.366128, iota_edge =
-0.06564537, and aspect ratio = 4.91473187.  See
stellopt_1iter/stellopt.nfp2_QA for the initial Boozer amplitudes.

To about 3 digits, the same optimum is found by stellopt's native
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, stellopt with GSL's Levenberg-Marquardt
algorithm via MANGO, and simsopt. The simsopt optimum values are

rc(0, 1) =  0.12363398
rc(1,-1) = -0.11329485
rc(1, 0) =  0.18023395
rc(1, 1) =  0.01568308
zs(0, 1) =  0.14350193
zs(1,-1) =  0.1025364
zs(1, 0) =  0.21716605
zs(1, 1) =  0.01254068

f = 0.00026889679
iota_edge = -0.49456795
aspect ratio = 6.0000696
