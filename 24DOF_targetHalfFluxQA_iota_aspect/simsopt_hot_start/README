In this directory, the initial condition is the final run
(wout_nfp2_QA_000_000738.nc) of
24DOF_targetHalfFluxQA_iota_aspect_medIota/simsopt_cold_start which is
a scenario very similar to this one but targeting iota = -0.475
instead of -0.47.  The number of Fourier modes was the same. For this
initial condition, the optimizer finds a good optimum, one with
positive shear.
