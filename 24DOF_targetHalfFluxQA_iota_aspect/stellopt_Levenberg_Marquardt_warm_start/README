In this directory, the initial condition is the final run
(wout_nfp2_QA_000_000212.nc) of the
8DOF_targetHalfFluxQA_iota_aspect/simsopt example. That example had a
similar objective function (though the target value of iota was
slightly different) and the boundary surface was constrained to have
fewer Fourier modes. Stellopt finds a good optimum.
