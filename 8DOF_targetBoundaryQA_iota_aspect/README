This is a 2-field-period vacuum configuration, constrained to have
elliptical cross-section. We optimize for quasi-axisymmetry, also
targeting iota so the optimum is not true axisymmetry, and also
targeting the aspect ratio so the aspect ratio does not increase. If
more Fourier modes were allowed in the boundary shape, decent
quasi-axisymmetry could be achieved. However, here the Fourier content
is kept small so the parameter space is only 8-dimensional.

Quasisymmetry is targeted at the boundary. In a more serious design,
quasisymmetry would probably be targeted at an interior surface
instead, but the boundary is targeted instead here so this case could
be reproduced with a vacuum Laplace solver instead of an MHD
equilibrium code. More precisely, quasisymmetry is evaluated at the
outermost half-grid surface, with ns=51 points in the full grid, so s
= 0.99000000.

Iota is targeted at the edge, with a target value of -0.495, to avoid
the resonance at -0.5.  We do not attempt to control magnetic shear
here, since this is hard to do without more poloidal modes in the
boundary shape.

For this scenario, the quasisymmetry objective has no s-dependent or
m-dependent weighting of the Boozer amplitudes.  In stellopt, this is
achieved by setting sigma < 0.

The objective function is:

f = (aspect - 6)^2 + (iota + 0.495)^2 + sum_{m,n}(B_{m,n} / B0)^2

where the sum is over all quasisymmetry-breaking modes, B_{m,n} are
the amplitudes of |B| in Boozer coordinates. The normalizing field is

B0 = sqrt(\sum_{m,n} B_{m,n}^2)

where now the sum includes only quasisymmetric modes.

Note that `vmec_axis_option="vmec"` in the stellopt cases. This
ensures that the same initialization of the magnetic axis is used in
stellopt and simsopt. If the axis is initialized differently, the
Boozer harmonics turn out a little different.

The parameter space is

rc(0, 1) 
rc(1,-1) 
rc(1, 0) 
rc(1, 1) 
zs(0, 1) 
zs(1,-1) 
zs(1, 0) 
zs(1, 1) 

where m comes before n (opposite to stellopt/vmec notation).

At the initial condition, B0 = 8.3134117, f = 1.3700911, iota_edge =
-0.06564577, and aspect ratio = 4.91473.  See
stellopt_1iter/stellopt.nfp2_QA for the initial Boozer amplitudes.

To about 3 digits, the same optimum is found by stellopt's native
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, stellopt with GSL's Levenberg-Marquardt
algorithm via MANGO, and simsopt. The simsopt optimum values are

rc(0, 1) =  0.11673911
rc(1,-1) = -0.11864656
rc(1, 0) =  0.1815689
rc(1, 1) =  0.02219165
zs(0, 1) =  0.1483621
zs(1,-1) =  0.09577609
zs(1, 0) =  0.21341956
zs(1, 1) =  0.01524933

f = 0.00098809
iota_edge = -0.4932136
aspect ratio = 6.000286
